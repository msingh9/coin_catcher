1) Create python virtual environment. Run following command from a
directory where you want to create the virtual environent.
 python -m venv <env name>

Example: (It will create env directory in the directory where you will
run this command from)

 python -m venv env

2) Activate the virtual environment
Please see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

 source env/bin/activate [On Unix or MacOS]
 env/Scripts/activate.bac [on Windows]
 
3) Install the dependencies
 python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

[Note: requirements.txt should be in git directory you cloned]


4) You can not run play.py.
 You can edit "policy" variable to play with different policies.
 human:  You play
 random: Random agent
 monte_carlo: Agent trained with monte carlo method to estimate Q(s,a)
 q_learning:  Q(s,a) learning by updating seen states and actions
 dqn       : Doble deep Q(s,a) network

5) You can train policy.py for your own state transformation to make
Q(s,a) learning useful under "q_learning". See method "_transform" in
policy.py. After training, it will save trained values in
trained_models. See code under "__main__" in policy.py.

To train Montel Carlo method, enable if condition in upper section of
code.

To train for q learning, enable if condition in lower section of the
code.

Models will be saved in trained_models folder.
